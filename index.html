        <p>
          This is one of my first programming projects, consisting of using the 3js library in javascript to create my own interactive webpage. I have also done class projects in my CS-102 course where I worked with reading text files in c++ and using that data to solve given prompts. I also have a keen interest in quant engineering and I hope to have my own hedge fund one day!

        <h2>🌮 Work History</h2>

        <h3>Nordstrom</h3>
        <p>
          I was a warehouse associate and worked to replenish inventory through gathering the necessary boxes of inventory and replenishing for pickers who sorted those into the diferent orders. I also worked to place inventory in the warehouse in strategic ways so it would be easier for anyone else looking for boxes to easily find them. I also worked as a runner someone who placed all shipped orders in trailers and sent them off to different fulfillment companies such as fedex and ups. I also worked in the outbound department where I stacked a set of clothing orders on a pallet and wrapped them and placed them inside different carriers.
